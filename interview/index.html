			<label for="answer01">Q. When did you start painting?<em></em></label>
			<div><p> I've been drawing since I was young. You know a friend in your class who asks you to draw something, I was one of those kids. I majored in design in college, but I don't have any friends who draw. It happened to be when I was 21 years old that a person who saw my  painting commissioned an exhibition and participated in a group exhibition at a small gallery in New York. I was introduced as a writer for the first time at that first time.</p></div>
			<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="answer02">
			<label for="answer02">Q. How did your college affect your job?<em></em></label>
			<div><p> I only went to classes that I liked. (laughs) My dream in high school was to become a fairy tale writer, so I entered the department of visual design without any knowledge, but when I went there, it was totally not. I don't think the college didn't give me a sense of design.</p></div>
			<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="answer03">
			<label for="answer03">Q. What do you usually draw?<em></em></label>
			<div><p> I like to draw things close to me. People alone in the room or in a bus that's being carried away in a daze somewhere. There are many paintings that reflect my situation and emotions at the time of drawing. I tend to get inspiration from my life, but if I don't go outside, I only draw what I see in the room.</p></div>
			<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="answer04">
			<label for="answer04">Q. What do you think are your strengths as a Illustrator? <em></em></label>
			<div><p> A good use of pink. It may sound arrogant, but I think it has overturned the usual use. I felt good when I heard "I didn't know pink was such a sad color."</p></div>
			<input type="radio" name="accordion"  id="answer05">
			<label for="answer05">Q. What is the final goal?<em></em></label>
			<div><p> I used to have a goal of doing these things as a illustrator, but now I think it's more important to take care of my life. I want to keep drawing as much as I want.</p></div>
